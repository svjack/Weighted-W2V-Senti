<!--
There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Time Series Forecast is useful in retail analysis in data analysis and mining. When it comes to hts data --- a data format that apply decoposition on massive
data, Many models have built on them. You can have a look at https://otexts.com/fpp2/hts.html
Nowadays, Many R packages have be developed. And you can find Scikit-Hts this python framework to perform similar tasks.
But there are many limits as follows:
* R packages such as gts and Scikit-Hts seems only support uni-feature time series, that you can not add other feature related with time series.
* Scikit-Hts have some Bugs with bottom up situation, which can be seen at https://github.com/carlomazzaferro/scikit-hts/issues/35
* Complex params fine-tuned on Prophet and the above framework (Scikit-Hts) may be difficult.

Sentiment Analysis is a basic task in NLP. There are some common used feature construction method for this task.
Such as : Tf-idf Word2Vec and some basic method based on sentiment dictionary on words.
Douban Movie Short Comments Dataset is a classical dataset for Sentiment Analysis.
You can take a look at https://www.kaggle.com/weiyunchen/nlp123, which use Tf-idf as feature and build DNN on Douban Movie Short Comments Dataset.

This work is inspired by that jupyter notebook. Also use a sample of the full datasets.
The Difference is that rather than use Tf-idf or average Word2Vec vectors as sentence vector, 
This project use Word2Vec and try to merge sentiment dictionary with Word2Vec.

The idea is simple, translation the Word2Vec vector to positive space and weighted vector by the sentiment dictionary.
The key is the construction of sentiment dictionary. It use simple voting on the full dataset. And filter out some invalid 
words (contains stopwords and others --- may be gap between sample and population)

The conclusion show that the Sentiment Weighted Word2Vec feature improve 6% balance accuracy than simple average Word2Vec feature
in Random Forest Model.

<!--
Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
